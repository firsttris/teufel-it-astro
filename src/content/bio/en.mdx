As a freelance software developer, I've been delivering high-quality <Link name="projects for enterprise companies" link="https://cv.teufel-it.de" /> for over 10 years.

My <Link name="open source projects" link="https://github.com/firsttris" /> on GitHub provide insight into my work and coding style.

One of my most popular open source projects, <Link name="Jest-Runner" link="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=firsttris.vscode-jest-runner" />, has been officially listed as a recommended VSCode extension by <Link name="NX" link="https://nx.dev/" /> since 2020 and is used by thousands of developers.
